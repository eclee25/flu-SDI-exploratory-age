Function: Grab data that can serve as a proxy for season severity
1) ILI cases over entire population during peak weeks
2) ILI cases over entire population during flu season (Oct to May)
3) ILI cases in acute care facilities during peak weeks
4) ILI cases in ERs during peak weeks

Decided that ILI cases in acute care facilities during peak weeks seem to best match the information

/* This seems to be a pretty good measure of severity. CDC indicates that season 3 and 7 were fairly mild, that season 8 was more severe than the previous three seasons and similar in severity to season 5. The population in acute care facilities doesn't seem to be affected by the vax shortage in season 5 as much, possibly because these individuals would have been high priorities to receive vaccine. Do we want this to reflect season severity independent of vaccine-related artifacts? */
