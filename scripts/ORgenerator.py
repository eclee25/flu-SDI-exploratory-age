###Author: Elizabeth Lee
###Date: 8/27/13

### Update from v070813
## Purpose: Return values from functions

### Update from v060713
## Purpose: Change data import mechanism from lists to dictionaries

###Function:
## generate a script of functions that can be called from other programs with the following functions:
### imports week-level and season-level data that is normalized by the US population, 'any diagnosis' counts from the SDI data, or 'popstat' variable by zipcode from the SDI data
### generates the odds ratios in list formats that make it easy to draw charts

###Import data: R_export/zipcode_bysseas_cl.csv (cleaned from SQL_export/zipcode_bysseas.csv)

###Command Line: python

# 'USchild' and 'USadult' are taken from 2010 Census age demographics, table 2: http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-03.pdf
# child = 5-19 yo, adult = 20-59 yo
