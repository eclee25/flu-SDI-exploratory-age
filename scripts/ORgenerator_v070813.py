###Python template
###Author: Elizabeth Lee
###Date: 7/8/13

### Update from v060713
## Purpose: Change data import mechanism from lists to dictionaries

###Function:
## generate a script of functions that can be called from other programs with the following functions:
### imports week-level and season-level data that is normalized by the US population, 'any diagnosis' counts from the SDI data, or 'popstat' variable by zipcode from the SDI data
### generates the odds ratios in list formats that make it easy to draw charts

###Import data: R_export/zipcode_bysseas_cl.csv (cleaned from SQL_export/zipcode_bysseas.csv)

###Command Line: python

### notes ###
# 'USchild' and 'USadult' are taken from 2010 Census age demographics, table 2: http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/briefs/c2010br-03.pdf
# child = 5-19 yo, adult = 20-59 yo

### functions ###

#### (import_d function) import ILI data into a dictionary where season number and agegroup are the key and ILI count is the value
# dict_data = empty dictionary where imported data will be stored, seascol = column number for season; agecol = column number for age group marker ('A', C', 'O'); ilicol = column number for ILI counts
# length of dictionary should equal number of rows in csvfile

	print "Length of dict_data: %d" % len(dict_data)

#### (ORgen_seas function) generate odds ratios at the season-level for a given list of attack rates for children and adults
# dict_data = completed dictionary with (season number, age group) as key and ILI count as value; dict_OR = empty dictionary where ORs will be stored; timelist = list of season numbers for which ORs will be calculated

	for t in timelist:

		a_attack = dict_data[(t,'A')]/USadult # calculate adult attack rate
		OR = (c_attack/(1-c_attack))/(a_attack/(1-a_attack)) # calculate odds ratio
		print OR
		dict_OR[t] = float(OR) # create dictionary for odds ratios
	print "Length of dict_OR: %d" % len(dict_OR)

#### (import_dwk function) import ILI data into a dictionary where season number and agegroup are the key and ILI count is the value
# dict_data = empty dictionary where imported data will be stored, seascol = column number for season; agecol = column number for age group marker ('A', C', 'O'); ilicol = column number for ILI counts; wklist = empty list where unique weeks will be appended

		dict_OR[w] = float(OR) # create dictionary for odds ratios
	print "Length of dict_OR: %d" % len(dict_OR)
