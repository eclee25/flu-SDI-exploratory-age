Function: Create table that lists week, week of year and season number; week 40 from year 1 to week 20 in year 2 == 1 season

7/7/13 update: added a column to season2 that represented season numbers where season was defined as the 6 weeks before and after the peak week. The season definition was truncated so as to reduce the possibility of age-specific noise in the tails of the epidemic curves for each season.

Command Line: run in parts
Data: flu table: SDI

/*
-- this code needs to be run in two separate parts; first data needs to be exported. once exported, a new column will be added manually that represents the season number. the expanded table will be imported into mysql as a new table called "season"
