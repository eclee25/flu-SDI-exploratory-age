###Python template
###Author: Elizabeth Lee
###Date: 10/31/14

## Purpose: script of functions for data cleaning and processing to draw flu severity figures; supports figures in create_fluseverity_figs
## v2: swap child:adult OR to adult:child OR
## v3: continue swap, adjust incidence for age-specific ILI HC seeking behavior, ratio of week-specific any diagnosis visits in S9/S#
## v4: change to relative risk, coverage adjustment: ratio of season-specific any diagnosis visits in S9/S#, care-seeking adjustment: age-specific ILI HC seeking behavior
## v5: coverage adjustments are all non-age-specific. care-seeking adjustments are all age-specific.

###Command Line: would not be called from command line directly
