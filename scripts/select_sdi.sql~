----characterizing the data----
--there is only one week's worth of 2000 data
--data is collected weekly
--AGEGROUP, SERVICE_PLACE, and PATIENT_ZIP3 have "total" categories that need to be utilized in order to capture the entirety of the data (active specification needed if no filtering on one of these three variables)

--explore 2000 data--
SELECT WEEK, ILI_m, ANY_DIAG_VISIT_CT, AGEGROUP from flu
WHERE (YEAR(WEEK) = 2010)
GROUP BY WEEK, AGEGROUP
;--2000 data only exists for the last week in 2000. this would explain the small numbers. 2010 data exists through end of June. Considering the truncation for this year, 2010 had a high number of ILI cases and total number of visits.
--the sums for ILI_m and ANY_DIAG_VISIT_CT for each AGEGROUP per WEEK do not sum add up to the total values for "TOTAL" in AGEGROUP. The values are smaller. **NOTE: Need to specify "TOTAL" for each categorical variable (ie. agegroup, service_place, patient_zip3)

GROUP BY WEEK
;--ILI diagnosis peaks occur approximately once a year (in terms of counts and proportion of visits) for a period of 4-8 consecutive weeks. They occur during the winter months -- starting in November for some years and as late as February in other years. These peaks consisted of at least 1% of all diagnoses being ILI for that week.
